# QuoteCollection

This is combined code for parts one and two of our Quote Collection Web Application. Users can add, view, update, and delete favorite quotes along with the author's name. In part two, we added full authentication functionality, and all user data is stored in local storage.

Users can:
- log in, logout, and register
- add, view, update, and delete quotes
